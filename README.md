## Notes:
* Take a screenshot of the desktop image that you want to be opened by double-clicking and save it to the "img" folder.
* For daily use, it is recommended to select a static desktop image to avoid affecting image recognition.
* When using the program, make sure that the shortcut command is not covered by other windows.
* Currently, it is not possible to install the Python environment through "requirements.txt" file. You need to manually install it.
